Introduction:

The purpose of the work described in this report is to develop
a piece of electronic hardware that could be used in a communications
laboratory to demonstrate convincingly the principles of Fourier Analysis . A
primary goal is to create a laboratory instrument of sufficient precision and
flexibility to generate a wide variety of waveshapes.

It can be shown that the Fourier series converges to f(t), except at
points of discontinuity, if f(t) satisfies the Dirichlet conditions . Any physically
realisable signal satisfies the strong Dirichlet condition by remaining finite in
amplitude and containing only a finite number of minima and maxima per
period.
The real time Fourier Synthesizer described in this report allows the operator
to generate any waveform that can be described by the following equation -

where: -10 volt < a < +10 volt and -10 volt < b < +10 volt
A choice had to be made between designing an instrument to
synthesise a Fourier series in the sine-cosine form previously shown or
its alternate form represented by the following -

The amplitude coefficient, C , is very easy to synthesise with analog
computing circuitry but the phase, θ , is difficult to synthesise, with
suitable accuracy The major source of phase error would
be the active RC bandpass filter circuits.

Since the Square wave function f(x) is odd ,

The Fourier series is therefore

A simplified block diagram for the basic system is shown in
Below Fig . The 5 harmonically related frequencies are derived from a
single stable reference oscillator with digital counter circuits
A sine wave with amplitude proportional to the potentiometer , is generated by
rejecting all harmonic Fourier components of the
square wave with a bandpass filter tuned to the fundamental frequency
of the square wave The phase, θ, of the sine wave is determined by
the relative amplitudes of the cosine coefficient, a^n, and the sine
coefficient, b^n , The outputs of the 5 bandpass
filters are summed to be displayed on an oscilloscope.

Bandpass Filter

To optimise the performance of the bandpass filters, meticulous attention was
paid to the adjustable parameters, particularly R2 and R1. Given that R2
predominantly influences Q and phase without impacting gain, it was outfitted
with a trimmer for fine-tuning the centre frequency or phase adjustment. This
adjustment proved crucial, as the centre frequency is inversely proportional to
capacitance (denoted as G) facilitated the creation of nearly identical
bandpass filters for each harmonic, differing only in capacitance values.
Conversely, R1 significantly influences transfer gain, thus requiring careful
calibration for ensuring uniform amplitude matching between harmonics. By
implementing trimmers for both R1 and R2 adjustments, we achieved precise
control over the bandpass filter characteristics, enhancing the fidelity and
consistency of waveform synthesis.

In our setup, we incorporated two operational amplifier ICs. The first op-amp
serves to summate the outputs originating from the active bandpass filters.
Meanwhile, the second op-amp functions as an active inverting buffer,
effectively restoring the original polarity of the summed signal obtained from
the adder circuit. Through this process, we achieve the generation of the
desired square waveform by amalgamating all the odd sine harmonics derived
from an oscillator. This comprehensive approach ensures the accurate
reconstruction of the intended waveform, culminating in a precise output
representation.
